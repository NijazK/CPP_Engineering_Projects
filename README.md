# C++ Engineering Projects
A curated list of Undergraduate level C++ programs for engineering applications. This list mainly utilizes arrays and matrices to solve linear or dynamic engineering problems. In addition, There was a combination of MATLAB and Python used to help divide and conquer the problems for C++. Thank you to the dedicated STEM faculty (electrical engineering, software engineering, and mathematics) for assisting the development of these projects.
